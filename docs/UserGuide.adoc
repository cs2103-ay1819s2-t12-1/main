== Introducing HMS+

HMS+ is for hotels that want to use a single, integrated system to *manage all aspects of their service*. As a command line app, HMS is highly customisable to match the needs for different hotels and allows easy scripting for batch processing.

This user guide provides in-depth documentation on the HMS+ installation process, system configuration and management, monitoring and troubleshooting problems. In addition the <<Getting Started>> will provide the basic knowledge of the setup process and how you can get started.

== Getting Started

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `hms.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Hotel Management System.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
+

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`listcustomers`* : lists all customers
* **`addcustomer`**`n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com id/887 a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : adds a customer named `John Doe` to the HMS+ database.
* **`deletecustomer`**`3` : deletes the 3rd customer  shown in the current list
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

== Features

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g. `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items in curly brackets separated by a slash (`/`) are interchangeable (entering either of those items have the same effect) e.g. `{addcustomer/ac}` are three aliases of the same command.
* Items with `…` after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]…` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
