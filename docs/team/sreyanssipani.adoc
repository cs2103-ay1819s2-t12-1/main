== PROJECT: HMS+

---

== Overview

HMS+ is a hotel management system made for hotels to manage their customers and their relevant transactions.
The hotel staff interacts with it using a Command Line Interface (CLI), and it has a Graphical User Interface (GUI) created with JavaFX.
It is written in Java and has around 15k LOC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: Added the complete backend for the booking and reservation from commands upto storage
** What it does: It allows the hotel staff to add service-bookings and reservations for the customers.
** Justification: This is the backbone of the application as these are the main amenities of any hotel.
** Highlights: This enhancement required in-depth analysis of the codebase as it involved extending a single-model dependent system to a multi-model based system.
I had to make sure the design implementation preserved the extensibility of the system as well as allowed the different components to interact with each other.
** Credits: I mainly used the concepts from the existing codebase and those that were taught in CS2103T to implement my features.
