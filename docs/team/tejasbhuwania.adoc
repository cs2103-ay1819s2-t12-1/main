== PROJECT: HMS+

---

== Overview

HMS+ is a hotel management system made for hotels to manage their customers and their relevant transactions.
The hotel staff interacts with it using a Command Line Interface (CLI), and it has a Graphical User Interface (GUI) created with JavaFX.
It is written in Java and has around 15k LOC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: Added the complete backend for the bill generating commands.
** What it does: It allows the hotel staff to generate bills for the customers.
** Justification: This is important for the application as this generates the bill for the amenities used by the customer during his stay in the hotel.
** Highlights: This enhancement allows the user to generate bills for a specific customer, a specific booking or a specific reservation. I had
to make sure that I use the already implemented reservation and booking models while creating the newer bill model and make sure that the model has access to all bookings and reservations
simultaneously so that it can generate the bill based on the command entered by the user.
** Credits: I mainly used the concepts from the existing codebase and those that were taught in CS2103T to implement my features.

as a Hotel Management System these are important fields to identify a customer.
** Made the UI more understandable to a first time user. https://github.com/cs2103-ay1819s2-t12-1/main/pull/145[#145], https://github.com/cs2103-ay1819s2-t12-1/main/pull/146[#146]

* *Other contributions*:

** Project management:
*** Did the jar release for Dry Run of CS2103 Practical Exam.
*** Created a separate issue for all the user stories with labels, milestones and assignees. https://github.com/cs2103-ay1819s2-t12-1/main/issues/82[#82] to https://github.com/cs2103-ay1819s2-t12-1/main/issues/110[#110]
*** Reviewed and approved several PRs. https://github.com/cs2103-ay1819s2-t12-1/main/pull/173[#173]
*** Reported and fixed bugs along with suggestions for team-mates. https://github.com/cs2103-ay1819s2-t12-1/main/pull/175[#175]
*** Kept on updating the user guide based on the features getting implemented in the application.
** Enhancements to existing features:
*** Added aliases for each command so that the user can type a shorter version of the same command. https://github.com/cs2103-ay1819s2-t12-1/main/pull/2[#2]
*** Made the Address field of a customer https://github.com/cs2103-ay1819s2-t12-1/main/pull/132[optional] for the user to input.
** Documentation:
*** Added Prefix list to the user guide so that the user can easily refer to the prefixes in case required.
*** Added color-coding to the user guide so that the user can easily understand the difference between the command word, the command prefixes and the command parameters.

** Tools:
*** Set Up Asciidoctor. This helps in converting asciidocs to html files and viewing how will the file look as a Web page.
